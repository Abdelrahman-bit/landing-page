                <p>Pre-programmed robots operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks. An
                    example of a pre-programmed robot would be a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line. The arm
                    serves one function — to weld a door on, to insert a certain part into the engine, etc. — and it's
                    job is to perform that task longer, faster and more efficiently than a human.</p>

                <p>Teleoperated robots are mechanical bots controlled by humans. These robots usually work in extreme
                    geographical conditions, weather, circumstances, etc. Examples of teleoperated robots are the
                    human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used
                    to detect landmines on a battlefield.</p>
